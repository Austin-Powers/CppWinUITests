// This is the solution to what has to be the strangest linker error I ever received,
// where it simultaniously has the unresolved external symbol simplex2 and hints at the symbol simplex2.
// This might have something to do with using a relative path to the source,
// but as a matter of fact I already spent too much time on using simplex noise without just copying
// someone elses code directly into my project and I just want to get on with the actual project.
//
// FYI: This is copying the code indirectly so it is fine by me.

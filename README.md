# C++ Windows UI without Qt Tests
Testing different ways to create a UI for a C++ application on Windows without using Qt

# Motivation
![Alt text](https://i.imgflip.com/2v1rjh.png "a title")

For some of my image experiments I would prefer having a GUI to directly display the results. I wanted to use Qt, but I do not want to create an Qt Account or navigate for hours on their website to find the other options people have told me about. And for me that is enough motivation to try different ways to create GUI for C++ application using the tool already provided with the Visual Studio installtion.

# Setup
The GUI shall display images generated by a simulation and the performance shall be measured. The simulation shall be influenced by clicking on the image to test how interactive the GUI is.

Simulation
----------
As the generator for the images this [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjoM9oKOAKY) by [The Coding Train Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain) shall be used.

# Windows API
This approach promises the highest speed as we do everything in C++, but as this API is quite old and written in C it might also be the slowest to implement.

__Note:__ Most of the information about how to develop GUI-applications was gathered from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/learnwin32/learn-to-program-for-windows).

__Note:__ If you are using CMake like me, you have to add

`target_link_options(<yourProjectName> PRIVATE "/SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS")`

to the *CMakeLists.txt* file, to let the linker know you are creating a window-application.

# C++ Windows UI without Qt Tests
Testing different ways to create a UI for a C++ application on Windows without using Qt

# Motivation
![Alt text](https://i.imgflip.com/2v1rjh.png "a title")

For some of my image experiments I would prefer having a GUI to directly display the results. I wanted to use Qt, but I do not want to create an Qt Account or navigate for hours on their website to find the other options people have told me about. And for me that is enough motivation to try different ways to create GUI for C++ application using the tool already provided with the Visual Studio installtion.

# Projects
- __cSharpConnector__ C++ application performing simulation and rendering, conncects to a C# application via sockets
- __cSharpUI__ C# application connecting to the the C++ application to display its results
- __fileExporter__ C++ application running a single simulation and rending step and writing the result to a file
- __renderer__ C++ library for rendering simulation states
- __renderer_tests__ C++ application testing the renderer library
- __simulation__ C++ library for performing the particle simulation
- __simulation_tests__ C++ application testing the simulation library
- __winapi__ C++ application running simulation and rendering and displaying the results

# Setup
The GUI shall display images generated by a simulation. The simulation shall be influenced by clicking on the image to test how interactive the GUI is.

Simulation
----------
As the generator for the images this [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjoM9oKOAKY) by [The Coding Train Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain) shall be used.

# Windows API
This approach promises the highest speed as we do everything in C++, but as this API is quite old and written in C it might also be the slowest to implement.

__Note:__ Most of the information about how to develop GUI-applications was gathered from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/learnwin32/learn-to-program-for-windows).

__Note:__ If you are using CMake like me, you have to add

`target_link_options(<yourProjectName> PRIVATE "/SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS")`

to the *CMakeLists.txt* file, to let the linker know you are creating a window-application.

# C#-UI connects via Socket
This approach promises the easiest way to create the UI. The simulation and rendering will be done in a C++ application. Displaying as well as user input will be done by a C# application.
The C# application will start the C++ application and connect to it via sockets and loopback.

__Note:__ During the work in this approach several drawbacks were noticed:
- Building the two applications in an automated way is quite tricky (it was therefore omitted)
- Stoping the C++ application can be very tricky at some times
- In general the whole netcode makes this solution very complicated and error prone

__Note:__ There are surely solutions to all the problems mentioned above, but with the Windows API working as well as it does, there is actually no need to invest more time into this approach at the moment

# Other Solutions
There are at least two more ways to achieve the desired result:
- C# including the C++-Code as a DLL
- C++/CLI

Given the learnings from the __C#-UI connects via Socket__ those are most likely difficult to build using CMake and as mentioned above, for me the goal behind this project was already achieved with the Windows API approach

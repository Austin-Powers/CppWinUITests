# C++ Windows UI without Qt Tests
Testing different ways to create a UI for a C++ application on Windows without using Qt

# Motivation
![Alt text](https://i.imgflip.com/2v1rjh.png "a title")

For some of my image experiments I would prefer having a GUI to directly display the results. I wanted to use Qt, but I do not want to create an Qt Account. And for me that is enough motivation to try different ways to create GUI for C++ application using the tool already provided with the Visual Studio installtion.

# Setup
The GUI shall display images generated by a simulation and the performance shall be measured. The simulation shall be influenced by clicking on the image to test how interactive the GUI is.

Simulation
----------
As the generator for the images this [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjoM9oKOAKY) by [The Coding Train Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain) shall be used.
